# Installation

<!--
  Do not link to the release assets by hand. The hub serves the managed and
  unmanaged downloads for the version the reader is viewing, and a hard-coded
  link goes stale on the next release.
-->

:::steps
1. Download the **managed** solution for your environment.
2. In the Power Platform admin centre, import the solution.
3. Publish all customizations.
4. Enable **Code components for canvas apps** if this control is used there.
:::

:::callout{type=warning}
Import the managed solution into production. The unmanaged one is for a
development environment where you intend to change the control itself — it
cannot be cleanly uninstalled.
:::

## Requirements

The control asks for one permission at import: **WebAPI**, used for a single
call — reading the body of the file being downloaded. There is nothing else to
install, and no framework is bundled.

For canvas apps, code components must be enabled in the environment. Note that
downloading does not work there; see *Canvas apps*.
